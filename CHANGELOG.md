_January 29, 2026_

FEATURES:

- Add session persistence support for NGINX OSS and NGINX Plus. OSS and Plus users can configure `ip_hash` via `UpstreamSettingsPolicy` to provide client IP–based session affinity, while NGINX Plus users can configure `sessionPersistence` on `HTTPRoute` and `GRPCRoute` rules to enable cookie-based session persistence. Cookie-based session persistence is available only to NGINX Plus users and is currently in experimental mode. [4471](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/4471)
- Support Rate Limiting through RateLimitPolicy API. [4633](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/4633)
- Allow configuring specific namespaces to watch for resources, instead of watching all namespaces by default. [4606](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/4606)
- Allow users to specify `escape` format when customizing the data plane access logs. [4530](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/4530). Thanks to [michasHL](https://github.com/michasHL).
- Enables the `keepAlive` directive with a default value of 16 to reduce connection setup overhead. This default can be overridden by an UpstreamSettingsPolicy, or disabled entirely by setting `keepAlive.connections` to 0. [4524](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/4524)
- Support for TCPRoute and UDPRoute. [4518](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/4518). Thanks to [Skcey](https://github.com/Skcey).
- Support Basic Auth through AuthenticationFilter. [4575](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/4575)

- `nginxGateway.snippetsFilters.enable` value in the Helm chart and `--snippets-filters` flag in Kubernetes manifests has been deprecated in favour of the `nginxGateway.snippets.enable` value and `--snippets` flag. The new `snippets` value and flag will enable both `SnippetsFilter` and `SnippetsPolicy` APIs. View the updated guide on [Snippets](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-gateway-fabric/traffic-management/snippets/) for more.

MAINTENANCE:

- Refactor unit tests to use `t.Context()` instead of `context.TODO()` or `context.Background()` to prevent potential goroutine leaks. [4355](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/4355). Thanks to [richie-king](https://github.com/richie-king).

## Release 2.0.0

_June 5, 2025_

BREAKING CHANGES:

[How to upgrade to 2.0.0](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-gateway-fabric/install/upgrade-version/#upgrade-from-v1x-to-v2x).

The following changes are breaking and require users to fully uninstall NGINX Gateway Fabric (including NGINX Gateway Fabric CRDs) before re-installing the new version. Gateway API resources (such as Gateway, HTTPRoute, etc) are unaffected and can be left alone. [3318](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/3318)

- Control plane and data plane have been separated into different Deployments. The control plane will provision an NGINX data plane Deployment and Service when a Gateway object is created.
- NginxProxy CRD resource is now namespace-scoped (was cluster-scoped).
- NginxProxy resource controls infrastructure fields for the NGINX Deployment and Service, such as replicas, loadBalancerIP, serviceType, etc. Users who want to set or update these fields must do so either at installation time through the helm chart (which sets them globally), or per Gateway. Updating these fields directly on a provisioned nginx Deployment or Service will not take effect. This does not apply to the the NGINX Gateway Fabric control plane Deployment.
- Helm values structure has changed slightly to better support the separate Deployments.
- `nginxGateway.replicaCount` Helm value has been renamed to `nginxGateway.replicas`.

FEATURES:

- Support for creating and deploying multiple Gateways. [3318](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/3318)
- NginxProxy resource can now additionally be attached to a Gateway, and will overwrite any settings that are attached at the GatewayClass level, for the Gateway that it's attached to. [3318](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/3318)
- Listener isolation supported for all routes. [3067](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/3067)
- Allow configuration of NGINX Plus API access. [3066](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/3066)
- Adds regex matching for headers and query params for HTTPRoutes and headers for GRPCRoutes. [3093](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/3093)
- Add support for request mirroring using the RequestMirror filter. [3066](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/3306)
- Adds support for Secrets to be used in BackendTLSPolicy for TLS certificates and CA certificates. [3084](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/3084). Thanks to [porthorian](https://github.com/porthorian).

BUG FIXES:

- Fix an issue where default headers were still being set when overwritten by a user. [3249](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/3249)
- Add 503 status code when there are zero upstream endpoints. [3406](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/3406)
- Fixed bug that occurred when a route's ParentRef does not include a sectionName and the Gateway's listeners have duplicate hostnames. This would cause conflicts when the route tries to attach to all the listeners and falsely trigger validation checks around overlapping routes. [3418](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/3418)

DOCUMENTATION:

- Migrated the documentation website into the [NGINX documentation repository](https://github.com/nginx/documentation). [3047](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/3047)

HELM CHART:

- The version of the Helm chart is now 2.0.0
- Helm values structure has changed slightly to better support the separate Deployments.
- `nginxGateway.replicaCount` Helm value has been renamed to `nginxGateway.replicas`.
- Add support for control plane Deployment labels. [3194](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/3194). Thanks to [Butterneck](https://github.com/Butterneck).

UPGRADE:

- [Upgrade to 2.0.0](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-gateway-fabric/install/upgrade-version/#upgrade-from-v1x-to-v2x)

KNOWN ISSUES:

- NGINX LoadBalancer Service IPFamily uses Kubernetes default (likely SingleStack IPv4) instead of matching the ipFamily set in the NginxProxy resource, which defaults to DualStack. [3473](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/issues/3473)

## Release 0.1.0

_August 22, 2022_

This is an initial release of NGINX Kubernetes Gateway project.

The release includes:

- A control plane agent (a Kubernetes controller) that updates date plane (NGINX) configuration based on the state of
  the resources in the cluster.
- Support for NGINX as a data plane.
- Kubernetes manifests for a Deployment with a single Pod with the control plane and data plane containers as well as
  Services to enable external connectivity to that Pod.
- Support for a subset of features of GatewayClass, Gateway and HTTPRoute resources (see the [Gateway API Compatibility doc](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/blob/v0.1.0/README.md)).

We expect that the architecture of NGINX Kubernetes Gateway -- the number of pods and containers and their
interaction -- will change as the project evolves.

NGINX Kubernetes Gateway is ready for experimental usage. We included
the [docs](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/tree/v0.1.0/docs) as well
as [examples](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/tree/v0.1.0/examples).

If you'd like to give us feedback or get involved, see
the [README](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric) to learn how.
