# Enhancement Proposal 4687: OpenID Connect

- Issue: [4687](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/issues/4687)
- Status: Provisional

## Summary

Enable NGINX Gateway Fabric to support centralized authentication enforcement using OpenID Connect (OIDC). This feature will be available only for NGINX Plus users.

## Goals

- Design a solution to support OIDC authentication that is compatible with multiple Identity Providers (IdPs).
- Extend the AuthenticationFilter CRD to allow users to configure OIDC authentication settings.

## Non-Goals

- Define implementation details for OIDC authorization.
- Support OIDC authorization for TCP and UDP routes.
- This design will not determine or enforce what actions a user is allowed to perform.
- Support authentication mechanisms outside of OIDC.
