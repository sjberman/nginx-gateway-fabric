## Summary: 

- 4 out of 5 tests showed slight latency increases, consistent with the trend noted in the 2.1.0 summary
- The latency differences are minimal overall, with most changes under 1%.
- The POST method routing increase of ~2.2% is the most significant change, though still relatively small in absolute terms (~21µs).
- All tests maintained 100% success rates with similar throughput (~1000 req/s), indicating that the slight latency variations are likely within normal performance variance.
