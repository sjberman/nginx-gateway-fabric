- Dirty: false

GKE Cluster:

- Node count: 12
- k8s version: v1.33.2-gke.1240000
- vCPUs per node: 16
- RAM per node: 65851524Ki
- Max pods per node: 110
- Zone: us-west1-b
- Instance Type: n2d-standard-16

## Summary:

- This is the first test result since the 2.0 architecture change since you cannot upgrade from 1.6 -> 2.0. With this test setup, there is downtime when upgrading NGF. 
- There is a manual workaround for this release which involves uninstalling then re-installing NGF, which should lead to no downtime on the data plane. Hopefully our new readiness probe will fix this issue in the next release.

## Test: Send https /tea traffic
