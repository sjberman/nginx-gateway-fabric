## Summary

- Same amount of errors in logs, decrease from the historic past.
- Batch processing numbers stayed the same for most of the tests except for the Upstream Servers, where there was a near 2x increase in total batch processing with a lower average time. 
- Lower latency in HTTPMatches test case.
- Memory and CPU usage stayed similar.
- Similar result trend with 2.4 oss results.
