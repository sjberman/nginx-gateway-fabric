- Commit: 43424f7eafc27e3fed07cef693614a7f389a3359
- Date: 2025-08-12T16:35:50Z
- Dirty: false

GKE Cluster:

- Node count: 12
- k8s version: v1.33.2-gke.1240000
- vCPUs per node: 16
- RAM per node: 65851524Ki
- Max pods per node: 110
- Zone: us-west1-b
- Instance Type: n2d-standard-16

## Summary:

- Latency in requests remained consistent with 2.0 results.
- 502 errors from 2.0 results still remain, but have decreased in frequency (success rate is higher and number of tests which have errors have decreased). 

## One NGINX Pod runs per node Test Results
